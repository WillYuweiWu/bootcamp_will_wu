# Chosen Audience and Rationale

The primary audience for this work is internal stakeholders and decision makers (e.g. managers, analysts, strategists) who require both transparent analysis and actionable insights. These stakeholders need to see not only the results, but also the assumptions, data transformations, and sensitivity checks that lead to those results. By exposing the analytical process, we build confidence in the findings and enable informed decision-making.

# Why this Format

The Jupyter Notebook with Markdown commentary is suited for this audience because it combines:

- Code, outputs, and visual deliverables in one place, ensuring that all results could be directly traced to the underlying computation.
- Markdown narratives that could provide plain interpretations of technical results. 
- Reproducibility and transparency, allowing colleagues to revisit, rerun, or adjust the analysis if new data or assumptions arise.
